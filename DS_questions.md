1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of neural networks?

Advantages: K-Nearest Neighbors have a nice intuitive explanation, and then tend to work very well for problems where comparables are inherently indicative. For example, you could build a kNN housing price model by modeling on other houses in the area with similar number of bedrooms, floor space, etc.

Disadvantages: They are memory-intensive.They also do not have built-in feature selection or regularization, so they do not handle high dimensionality well.

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a generative and discriminative model?

A generative model will learn categories of data while a discriminative model will simply learn the distinction between different categories of data. Discriminative models will generally outperform generative models on classification tasks.

3. You are working on a time series data set. You manager has asked you to build a high accuracy model. You start with the decision tree algorithm, since you know it works fairly well on all kinds of data. Later, you tried a time series regression model and got higher accuracy than decision tree model. 
Can this happen? Why?
