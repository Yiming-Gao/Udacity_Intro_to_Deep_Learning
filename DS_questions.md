1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of neural networks?
Advantages: K-Nearest Neighbors have a nice intuitive explanation, and then tend to work very well for problems where comparables are inherently indicative. For example, you could build a kNN housing price model by modeling on other houses in the area with similar number of bedrooms, floor space, etc.

Disadvantages: They are memory-intensive.They also do not have built-in feature selection or regularization, so they do not handle high dimensionality well.
